What motivates me most is building software that actually gets used. Whether it's streamlining workflows, improving accessibility, or solving practical business problems, I believe technology should be purposeful, simple where possible, and effective where it matters. I'm particularly interested in early-stage products, MVPs, and tools that help individuals and businesses operate more efficiently.",
